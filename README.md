Twitter's frequent changes break the extension and demand significant development efforts. Therefore, I've chosen to discontinue the project due to low user adoption and minimal community involvement. Thank you for your support.

- **No more Distractions:** Twifiner goes beyond removing Ads - it declutters your Twitter by eliminating trends panel, subscribe to premium prompts, who to follow, footer, and other clutter.

- **Better Tweet Age Display:** Twifiner goes beyond showing tweet age in seconds, minutes, and hours, continuing to display it effortlessly in days, weeks, months, and years. It also removes the extra Id from the tweet for a sleek look.

- **Show Accounts Age:** With Twifiner, you can easily see an account's age at a glance in days, months, or years. No more math needed!

- **Multi-Calendar Date Display:** Twifiner now displays Islamic calendar dates (shamsi and ghamari) next to Gregorian dates in tweets. This adds context and convenience for users in Islamic countries. No more date conversions!

- **Better Persian Tweets:** Twifiner employs the user-friendly 'Vazirmatn' font (designed by the late Saber Rastikerdar) and fixes some common writing errors such as unusual characters, extra spaces, incorrect use of half-spaces, repeated emojis, and more.

- **Highlight What Matters:** With Twifiner, never miss replying to people who engage with you on Twitter. Reply notifications are highlighted, so they stand out among other notifications. Pinned tweets and mutual followers/following are also highlighted for easy access.

- **Access Advanced Search More Easily:** Twifiner adds a simple advanced search link to the search field, allowing you to access it more quickly than before.

- **Mute words without leaving your timeline:** Twifiner allows you to mute words directly from your timeline, effortlessly filtering out topics or phrases you prefer not to see. Keep your timeline focused on what matters most to you, without relying on Twitter's mute feature.

- **No Highlights Tab for Non-Premium Users:** Twitter sometimes shows a ‚ÄòHighlights‚Äô tab on your profile, even if you‚Äôre not a premium subscriber. Twifiner removes this tab for non-premium users.

- **Move Account Menu to Top:** Twifiner moves the account menu to the top of the page for easier access.

- **Make Hashtags Pop:** Twifiner removes the # symbol from hashtags and adds a subtle background to make them pop, enhancing their visibility and interactivity.

- **Ability to Hide Notification Tab Header:** Twifiner lets you hide the notification tab header, decluttering the notification area for a smoother experience. However, you can restore it if needed.
