- **No more Distractions:** Twifiner goes beyond removing Ads - it declutters your Twitter by eliminating trends panel, subscribe to premium prompts, who to follow, footer, and other clutter.

- **Better Tweet Age Display:** Twifiner goes beyond showing tweet age in seconds, minutes, and hours, continuing to display it effortlessly in days, weeks, months, and years. It also removes the extra Id from the tweet for a sleek look.

- **Show Accounts Age:** With Twifiner, you can easily see an account's age at a glance in days, months, or years. No more math needed!

- **No Highlights Tab for Non-Premium Users:** Twitter sometimes shows a ‘Highlights’ tab on your profile, even if you’re not a premium subscriber. Twifiner removes this tab for non-premium users.
